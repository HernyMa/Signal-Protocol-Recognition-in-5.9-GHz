To our best knowledge, it is the first to propose a neural network-based signal recognition method to detect the interference signal protocol in the 5.9 GHz unlicensed band. Almost all the existing works consider automatic modulation classification (AMC), which is not applicable in LTE and NR scenarios since the modulation schemes are only related to MCSs. In other words, different interference signals can have the same modulation schemes while signals of the same protocol usually have different modulation schemes.
